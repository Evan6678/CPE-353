## Alien Game  
This Game was written by me to further my understanding of the QT graphics library for my final exam. This game uses a MySQL database that contains all the image dependencies needed run the game. The game dynamically retrieves the images from the database to create new instances of the objects.    
### How to run the game
1.) download the source file  
2.) Open .pro in QT Creator   
3.) Once the game is compiled a build folder should be generated in the same location as the source folder  
4.) find the images.db file in the source folder and copy it into the new build folder  
5.) run the game and enjoy!! :)
